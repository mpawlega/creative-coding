FINE247 PROJECT 3
Cosmic Interlude of the Nebular Web
Alex Chau & Matilda Pawlega
TouchDesigner & Photoshop

==================================================

OVERVIEW

Cosmic Interlude of the Nebular Web explores interconnectedness through a dynamic cosmic environment. Clouds of dust and stars move together 
in a shared system, creating ripples across a responsive cosmic grid. A surrounding galaxy space with vibrant colour and light effects
emphasizes scale, coexistence, and interaction.

The project reflects on how elements of vastly different sizes—galaxies, stars, particles, and humans—each contribute meaningfully to the formation 
of the universe. Visual systems were created in TouchDesigner using SOP and TOP operators, including particles, force operators, feedback, and bloom effects.

Audio is sourced from “5,000 Exoplanets: Listen to the Sounds of Discovery (NASA Data Sonification)” by NASA, published on YouTube (March 21, 2022):
